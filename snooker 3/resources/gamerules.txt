At the beginning of a frame, the balls are set up in the arrangement shown in the illustration. 
The six colours (a term referring to all balls except the white and the reds) are placed on their own spots. 
On the baulk line, looking up the table from the baulk end, the green ball is located where the "D" meets the line on the left, 
the brown ball in the middle of the line, and the yellow ball where the "D" meets the line on the right. This order is often remembered
using the mnemonic God Bless You, the first letter of each word being the first letter of the three colours (Green, Brown, Yellow). 
The blue ball rests at the exact centre of the table, while the pink is placed midway between it and the top cushion. The red balls
 are arranged in a tightly-packed triangle behind the pink, with the apex as close as possible to the pink but not touching it. Finally,
  the black ball is placed on a spot 32.5 cm (12.8 in) from the top cushion,
 centred from left to right so that the brown, blue, pink, and black balls all sit on an imaginary line that bisects the table along its length.


 At the beginning of each frame, the balls are set up by the referee as explained. The frame begins with one player taking the cue ball "in-hand", placing it
  anywhere on or inside the D and attempting to hit one or more of the red balls on an initial break-off shot.
